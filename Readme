Thsi work present an advanced approach for detecting of diseases in apple leaf utilizing the Plant Pathology FGVC7 dataset. Our methodology leverages the EfficientNetB7 noisy student architecture, enhanced with the Noisy Student training technique and pre-trained 
weights through transfer learning. This integration of transfer learning significantly boosts the model’s performance by leveraging large-scale data from previous training, thus enhancing its ability to recognize complex patterns in the target dataset. Utilizing 
deep learning principles, our model demonstrates superior performance over previously proposed methods in the performance metrics and efficieny. For the optimization of model, we employ adam optimizer which is widely recognized for its capability to efficiently 
and effectively train deep learning models. Additionally, We employ a variety of data augmentation techniques to enhance the model’s ability to generalize effectively, ensuring robust performance across various real-world conditions. The outcomes indicate that 
the proposed approach establishes a new standard in the field of disease detection in plants and offering promising implications for precision agriculture.
